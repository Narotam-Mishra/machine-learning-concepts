    "### Types of Statistics :-\n",
    "1. Descriptive Statistics - Descriptive Statistics deals witht the collection, organization, analysis, Interpretation, and presentation of data. It focuses on summarizing and describing the main features of a set of data, without making inferences or predictions about the large population.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inferential Statistics - Inferential statistics deals with making conclusions and predictions about a population based on a sample. It involves the use of probability theory to estimate the likelihood of certain events occurring, hypothesis testing to determine if a certain claim about a population is supported by the data, and regression analysis to examine the relationships between variables.\n",

    "Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with making inferences or predictions about a larger population based on a sample of data. It involves using statistical techniques to test hypotheses and draw conclusions from data. Some of the topics that come under inferential statistics are :-\n",
    "- **Hypothesis testing**: This involves testing a hypothesis about a population parameter based \n",
    "on a sample of data. For example, testing whether the mean height of a population is \n",
    "different from a given value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Confidence intervals**: This involves estimating the range of values that a population \n",
    "parameter could take based on a sample of data. For example, estimating the population \n",
    "mean height within a given confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analysis of variance (ANOVA)**: This involves comparing means across multiple groups to \n",
    "determine if there are any significant differences. For example, comparing the mean \n",
    "height of individuals from different regions.\n",
    "\n",

    "variable and one or more independent variables. For example, predicting the sales of a \n",
    "product based on advertising expenditure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chi-square tests**: This involves testing the independence or association between two \n",

    "independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sampling techniques**: This involves ensuring that the sample of data is representative of \n",

    "- Trimmed Mean :- A trimmed mean is calculated by removing a certain percentage of the smallest and largest values (outliers) from the dataset and then taking the mean of the remaining values.

It is used to compare the variability of datasets with different means and is commonly used in fields such as biology, chemistry, and engineering. The coefficient of variation (CV) is a statistical measure that expresses the amount of variability in a dataset relative to the mean. It is a dimensionless quantity that is expressed as a percentage"
