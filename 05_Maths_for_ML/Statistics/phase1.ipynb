    "3. Government & Politics - Conducting surveys, Polling\n",

    "### Types of Statistics :-\n",
    "1. Descriptive Statistics - Descriptive Statistics deals witht the collection, organization, analysis, Interpretation, and presentation of data. It focuses on summarizing and describing the main features of a set of data, without making inferences or predictions about the large population.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inferential Statistics - Inferential statistics deals with making conclusions and predictions about a population based on a sample. It involves the use of probability theory to estimate the likelihood of certain events occurring, hypothesis testing to determine if a certain claim about a population is supported by the data, and regression analysis to examine the relationships between variables.\n",

    "Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with making inferences or predictions about a larger population based on a sample of data. It involves using statistical techniques to test hypotheses and draw conclusions from data. Some of the topics that come under inferential statistics are :-\n",
    "- **Hypothesis testing**: This involves testing a hypothesis about a population parameter based \n",
    "on a sample of data. For example, testing whether the mean height of a population is \n",
    "different from a given value.\n",
    "- **Confidence intervals**: This involves estimating the range of values that a population \n",
    "parameter could take based on a sample of data. For example, estimating the population \n",
    "mean height within a given confidence level.\n",
    "- **Analysis of variance (ANOVA)**: This involves comparing means across multiple groups to \n",
    "determine if there are any significant differences. For example, comparing the mean \n",
    "height of individuals from different regions.\n",
    "- **Regression analysis**: This involves modelling the relationship between a dependent \n",
    "variable and one or more independent variables. For example, predicting the sales of a \n",
    "product based on advertising expenditure.\n",
    "- **Chi-square tests**: This involves testing the independence or association between two \n",
    "categorical variables. For example, testing whether gender and occupation are \n",
    "independent variables.\n",
    "- **Sampling techniques**: This involves ensuring that the sample of data is representative of \n",
    "the population. For example, using random sampling to select individuals from a \n",
    "population.\n",
    "- **Bayesian statistics**: This is an alternative approach to statistical inference that involves \n",
    "updating beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. For example, \n",
    "updating the probability of a disease given a positive test result."
