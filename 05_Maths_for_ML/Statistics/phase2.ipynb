    "### Quantiles and Percentiles\n",
    "- Quantiles are statistical measures used to divide a set of numerical data into equal-sized groups, with each group containing an equal number of observations. Quantiles are important measures of variability and can be used to: understand distribution of data, summarize and compare different datasets. They can also be \n",
    "used to identify outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are several types of quantiles used in statistical analysis, including :-\n",
    "1. Quartiles: Divide the data into four equal parts, Q1 (25th percentile), Q2 \n",
    "(50th percentile or median), and Q3 (75th percentile).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Deciles: Divide the data into ten equal parts, D1 (10th percentile), D2 (20th percentile), ..., D9 (90th percentile).\n",

    "3. Percentiles: Divide the data into 100 equal parts, P1 (1st percentile), P2 (2nd percentile), ..., P99 (99th percentile).\n",
