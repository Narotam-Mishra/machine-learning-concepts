## AI Vs ML vs DL vs Data Science (00:01:25 )

### **1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)**  
- AI involves creating applications that perform tasks **without human intervention**.  
- Examples:  
  - **Netflix recommendations** (suggests movies based on viewing history).  
  - **Amazon product recommendations** (suggests related items like headphones after buying a phone).  
  - **Self-driving cars** (Tesla uses AI to navigate roads autonomously).  

### **2. Machine Learning (ML) – Subset of AI**  
- Provides **statistical tools** to:  
  - Analyze & visualize data.  
  - Make **predictions/forecasts** (e.g., sales forecasting, fraud detection).  
- Relies on **algorithms with statistical techniques** (e.g., regression, decision trees).  

### **3. Deep Learning (DL) – Subset of ML**  
- Mimics the **human brain** using **multi-layered neural networks**.  
- Solves **complex problems** (e.g., image recognition, speech processing).  
- Enabled breakthroughs in AI (e.g., ChatGPT, advanced computer vision).  

### **4. Data Science – The Bigger Picture**  
- A **data scientist** works across **AI, ML, and DL** depending on the business need.  
- Tasks may include:  
  - **Data analysis** (PowerBI, SQL).  
  - **ML/DL modeling** (predictive algorithms, neural networks).  
- Goal: **Build AI-driven solutions** for real-world problems.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
- **AI** → Autonomous decision-making.  
- **ML** → Stats-based predictions (subset of AI).  
- **DL** → Brain-inspired neural networks (subset of ML).  
- **Data Science** → Umbrella field combining all three for business solutions.  

- AI is a process wherein we create some kind of applications in which it will be able to do its task without any human intervention where it'll be able to make decisions and perfrom its tasks. Example - Netflix's Recommendation System, Self Driven Car (Tesla),

- Machine Learning is subset of AI where it provides stats tools to analyze the data, visualize the data and apart from that it used do predictions and forcasting.

- Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning. It's main aim is to mimic human brain so they actually create multi-layered neural network and this multi layered neural network will basically help us to train the machines or apps whatever we will try to create.

### Basic concepts of Neural Network
- A neural network is a computational model inspired by how biological neurons in the brain process information. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that can learn patterns from data.

**Basic Structure:**
- **Input Layer**: Receives data (like pixel values of an image)
- **Hidden Layer(s)**: Process and transform the data
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final result

**How it works:**
Each connection between neurons has a "weight" that determines how much influence one neuron has on another. During training, these weights are adjusted to minimize errors and improve predictions.

**Simple Examples:**

1. **Image Recognition**: A neural network can identify if an image contains a cat or dog by learning features like edges, shapes, and textures through its layers.

2. **Email Spam Detection**: The network learns to recognize patterns in email text (certain words, phrases, sender patterns) to classify emails as spam or legitimate.

3. **Handwriting Recognition**: When you write on your phone, neural networks recognize the shapes and strokes to convert your handwriting into text.

4. **Voice Assistants**: Neural networks process sound waves from your speech, convert them to text, understand the meaning, and generate appropriate responses.

The "deep" in deep learning refers to having many hidden layers (typically 3 or more), allowing the network to learn increasingly complex patterns and representations from the data.

## Machine Learning and Deep Learning (00:07:56)

1. **Supervised Machine Learning** Uses labeled training data (input-output pairs) to learn patterns and make predictions. The algorithm learns from examples where the correct answer is provided. Examples include email spam detection, image classification, and price prediction. (Uses labeled data for training)  
   - **Regression**: Predicts **continuous values** (e.g., predicting weight based on age).  
   - **Classification**: Predicts **discrete categories** (e.g., spam vs. not spam).  

2. **Unsupervised Machine Learning** Works with unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns or structures without knowing the "correct" answers. The algorithm finds relationships in data on its own. Examples include customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and data compression. (No labels, finds hidden patterns)  
   - **Clustering**: Groups similar data (e.g., customer segmentation).  
   - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces features while keeping key info (e.g., Principle Component Analysis (PCA)).

### Key Difference: 
Supervised learning learns from examples with known outcomes, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without being told what to look for. 

In case of Unsupervised learning, there is no dependent variable (output)

### **Example (Supervised Learning)**  
- **Dataset**: Age (input) → Weight (output).  
- If predicting **weight (numeric)** → **Regression**.  
- If predicting **weight category (e.g., underweight/healthy/overweight)** → **Classification**.  

- With respect to any kind of problem statement that we solve, the majority of the business use cases will be fall under two sections :-
1. Supervised ML :- In case, we will mainly solve two major problem statements 
    - Regression problem
    - Classification 

2. Unsupervised ML :- In this case, we will solve two kind of problems :-
    - Clustering
    - Dimensionality Reduction

## Regression And Classification (00:09:05)

#### **1. Classification (Supervised ML)**  
- **Problem Type**: Predicts **categorical outcomes** (discrete labels).  
  - **Binary Classification**: 2 outcomes (e.g., Pass/Fail based on study/sleep/play hours).  
  - **Multiclass Classification**: >2 outcomes (e.g., Grades A/B/C).  
- **Example**: Predict if a student **passes/fails** using study/sleep/play data.  

#### **2. Clustering (Unsupervised ML)**  
- **Goal**: Group similar data points **without labels**.  
- **Example**: **Customer segmentation** using Salary vs. Age data.  
  - Groups: "High-income young professionals," "Middle-class," etc.  
  - **Application**: Targeted ads (e.g., luxury products for high-income clusters).  

#### **3. Dimensionality Reduction (Unsupervised ML)**  
- **Goal**: Reduce features (e.g., 1000 → 100) while retaining key info.  
- **Algorithms**: PCA (Principal Component Analysis), LDA.  
- **Use Case**: Simplifying complex datasets for faster processing.

### 📌 What is **Linear Regression**?

**Linear Regression** is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** used for **predicting a continuous numerical value** based on one or more input features.

It finds the **best-fitting straight line** (also called the **regression line**) through a set of data points. The general equation for a simple linear regression is:

$$
y = mx + c
$$

Where:

* $y$ = predicted value (dependent variable)
* $x$ = input feature (independent variable)
* $m$ = slope of the line (how much $y$ changes for a unit change in $x$)
* $c$ = intercept (value of $y$ when $x = 0$)

For **multiple linear regression**, the equation extends to:

$$
y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \dots + w_nx_n + b
$$

---

### 🎯 Why Do We Need Linear Regression?

Linear Regression is useful for:

#### ✅ 1. **Prediction**

* Predict house prices, sales, or future trends based on input features (e.g., size, location).

#### ✅ 2. **Understanding Relationships**

* Analyze how different variables relate to one another.

  > Example: How does experience affect salary?

#### ✅ 3. **Baseline Model**

* Acts as a simple and fast **benchmark model** before using complex algorithms.

#### ✅ 4. **Interpretability**

* The coefficients (slopes) in the regression equation give insight into how much each feature impacts the output.

---

### 🧠 Real-World Examples

1. **House Price Prediction**

   * Inputs: Size, number of rooms, location
   * Output: Price of the house

2. **Stock Market Forecasting**

   * Inputs: Previous stock values, volume traded
   * Output: Next day's stock price

3. **Marketing**

   * Inputs: Ad budget on platforms
   * Output: Sales/revenue generated

### 📉 Visualization (Intuition)

Given a scatter plot of points, Linear Regression finds the "best line" that minimizes the error (distance) between the line and each point (using **least squares** method).

## Linear Regression Algorithm (00:18:14)
![Linear Regression](/notes/01_Linear_Regression_1.1.png)

**Linear Regression Problem Statement** - Suppose we have given dataset of age (on x-axis) & weight (on y-axis) on 2D plane of XY, where we have calculated weight on the basis of age. In case of Linear Regression, we will try to find best fit line which will help us to do the predicition, i.e wrt any new age (on x-axis) what will be output (weight on y-axis). So, Y-axis (weight) is linear function of X-axis (age)

In case of Linear Regression we try to create a model with the help of training dataset, where the model (hypothesis) takes new age (independent feature) and gives the output of weight and with the help of performance metrics we try to verify whether that model is performing well or not.

![Equation of a straight line](/notes/01_Linear_Regression_1.3.png)

### ✅ 1. **`y = mx + c`** (Standard Form in Algebra)

* **Used in:** Basic mathematics (algebra)
* **Meaning:**

  * `y` is the dependent variable.
  * `x` is the independent variable.
  * `m` is the **slope** (rate of change).
  * `c` is the **y-intercept** (value of `y` when `x = 0`).

#### 📌 Example:

Suppose we have:
`y = 2x + 3`

* This means the line has a slope `m = 2` and crosses the y-axis at `c = 3`.
* At `x = 0`: `y = 2(0) + 3 = 3`
* At `x = 1`: `y = 2(1) + 3 = 5`

---

### ✅ 2. **`y = β₀ + β₁x`** (Statistical/Regression Form)

* **Used in:** Simple Linear Regression (Statistics / Machine Learning)
* **Meaning:**

  * `β₀` is the **intercept** (like `c`)
  * `β₁` is the **coefficient** (slope, like `m`)
  * `x` is the input variable (independent variable)
  * `y` is the predicted value (dependent variable)

#### 📌 Example:

Let’s say:
`y = 1.5 + 0.8x`

* `β₀ = 1.5`, so when `x = 0`, `y = 1.5`
* `β₁ = 0.8`, which means for every increase in `x` by 1, `y` increases by 0.8.

---

### ✅ 3. **`hθ(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x`** (Hypothesis Function in Machine Learning)

* **Used in:** Hypothesis function in **Linear Regression** (ML context)
* **Meaning:**

  * `θ₀` is the bias term (intercept)
  * `θ₁` is the weight for the input feature `x`
  * `hθ(x)` means: the hypothesis function `h` parameterized by `θ`

#### 📌 Example:

Suppose we have:
`hθ(x) = 4 + 2x`

* If `x = 1`: `hθ(1) = 4 + 2(1) = 6`
* If `x = 3`: `hθ(3) = 4 + 2(3) = 10`

---

### 🎯 Summary

| Form               | Common In             | Formula              | Parameters |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------- | ---------- |
| `y = mx + c`       | Algebra               | Slope-Intercept Form | `m`, `c`   |
| `y = β₀ + β₁x`     | Statistics/Regression | Linear Regression    | `β₀`, `β₁` |
| `hθ(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x` | Machine Learning      | Hypothesis Function  | `θ₀`, `θ₁` |

They all represent the **same underlying linear relationship**, just expressed differently based on context.

![Cost function in Linear Regression](/notes/01_Linear_Regression_1.6.png)

In Linear Regression, the cost function measures how well your model's predictions match the actual data. It tells you how "wrong" the model is — and we try to minimize this cost to make better predictions.


### 💡 What is a Cost Function?

A **cost function** is a mathematical formula that calculates the **error** between predicted values and actual values.

For **Linear Regression**, the most commonly used cost function is:

### ✅ Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Squared Error function:

$$
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right)^2
$$

---

### 🔍 Explanation of Terms:

* `m` = number of training examples
* $h_\theta(x^{(i)})$ = predicted value (hypothesis) for the i-th example
* $y^{(i)}$ = actual value for the i-th example
* $\theta_0, \theta_1$ = model parameters (weights and bias)

The goal of training is to **find the values of** $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ that **minimize** $J(\theta)$.

---

### 📌 Example:

Let's take a small dataset:

| x (input) | y (actual) |
| --------- | ---------- |
| 1         | 2          |
| 2         | 3          |
| 3         | 5          |

Assume your model is:

$$
h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x = 0.5 + 1x
$$

Now compute predicted values:

| x | y (actual) | hθ(x) = 0.5 + 1x | Error (hθ(x) - y) | Squared Error |
| - | ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | 2          | 1.5              | -0.5              | 0.25          |
| 2 | 3          | 2.5              | -0.5              | 0.25          |
| 3 | 5          | 3.5              | -1.5              | 2.25          |

Now plug into cost function:

$$
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2 \cdot 3}(0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25) = \frac{1}{6}(2.75) \approx 0.458
$$

So, the **cost** is around **0.458**. If you change the model (adjust θ₀ and θ₁), your cost will change — and your goal is to **minimize** it!

---

### 🧠 Intuition

Think of the cost function like this:

> The lower the cost, the better your model is fitting the data.

---

## 🔹 **1. Problem Statement of Linear Regression**

* Goal: Predict a **continuous target variable `y`** (e.g., weight) based on an **independent variable `X`** (e.g., age).
* This is achieved by **fitting a straight line** through the data.
* Model is trained on a **training dataset**, then used to **predict unseen data**.

---

## 🔹 **2. Hypothesis / Model Equation**

* The linear regression model assumes the relationship:

  $$
  h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 \cdot x
  $$
* Common notations:

  * $y = mx + c$
  * $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$
  * $h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x$

---

## 🔹 **3. Components of the Model**

### 📌 `θ₀` (Theta 0)

* **Intercept**: The value of `y` when `x = 0`
* Graphically, it is the **point where the line cuts the y-axis**

### 📌 `θ₁` (Theta 1)

* **Slope / Coefficient**: The rate at which `y` changes with `x`
* Interpreted as: **"With one unit increase in `x`, how much does `y` change?"**

---

## 🔹 **4. Goal of Linear Regression**

* To find the **best fit line** such that:

  * The **distance between actual values (`y`) and predicted values (`hθ(x)`) is minimized**
* This is measured using a **cost function**.

---

## 🔹 **5. Cost Function (Squared Error Function)**

* Formula:

  $$
  J(\theta_0, \theta_1) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2
  $$

### Key Points:

* $h_\theta(x)$: Prediction from the model.
* $y$: Actual value from the dataset.
* $m$: Number of training examples.
* **Why square the errors?**

  * To avoid cancellation of positive and negative errors.
* **Why divide by 2m?**

  * `1/m` gives average.
  * `1/2` simplifies derivative calculations in **Gradient Descent**.

---

## 🔹 **6. Error Minimization**

* The aim is to **find values of θ₀ and θ₁** that **minimize** the cost function.
* This is where **optimization algorithms** like **Gradient Descent** are used.

---

## 🔹 **7. Visual Intuition with Example**

* Example Dataset: $(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)$
* Trying different values of θ₁:

  * **θ₁ = 1**: Perfect fit (all points lie on line), **cost = 0**
  * **θ₁ = 0.5**: Worse fit, cost ≈ 0.58
  * **θ₁ = 0**: Worst fit, cost ≈ 2.3

---

## 🔹 **8. Cost Function Plot (J vs θ₁)**

* Graph of cost function vs slope (θ₁) shows a **U-shaped curve**
* Lowest point is the **Global Minimum**

  * At this point, **J(θ₀, θ₁)** is the smallest
  * This value of θ₁ gives the **best fit line**

---

## 🔹 **9. Gradient Descent (Optimization Approach)**

* **Iteratively updates** θ₀ and θ₁ to move **towards the global minimum**
* Update rule:

  $$
  \theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} J(\theta_0, \theta_1)
  $$

  * $\alpha$: Learning rate
  * $\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j}$: Partial derivative with respect to θ₀ or θ₁

---

---

## 🔁 **Gradient Descent & Convergence Algorithm in Linear Regression**

### 🧠 **Motivation**

* Instead of **randomly assuming values** of parameters like θ₁ (theta₁), we want a **systematic way** to **reach the global minimum** of the cost function (J).
* To achieve this, we use an **iterative optimization technique** called **Gradient Descent**.

---

### 📉 **Cost Function Recap**

* The **cost function (J(θ₀, θ₁))** is a **U-shaped curve** (for linear regression).
* Our goal is to **minimize this cost** by updating θ₀ and θ₁.
* The **global minimum** is the lowest point on this curve.

---

### 🔁 **Convergence Algorithm (Gradient Descent Update Rule)**

#### 🔹 Repeat Until Convergence:

```text
θj := θj - α * ∂/∂θj ( J(θ₀, θ₁) )
```

Where:

* **θj** is the parameter to be updated (e.g., θ₀ or θ₁)
* **α** is the **learning rate**
* **∂/∂θj J(θ₀, θ₁)** is the **derivative** (slope) of the cost function with respect to θj

---

### 📐 **Derivative (Slope) Intuition**

* **Positive Slope** → Move **left** (decrease θ)
* **Negative Slope** → Move **right** (increase θ)
* The **slope** (gradient) tells us the **direction and magnitude** of update needed.

---

### ⚙️ **Learning Rate (α)**

* Controls the **step size** of each update.
* **Small α (e.g., 0.01)**:

  * Takes **small steps**, converges slowly, but **stable**.
* **Large α (e.g., 1)**:

  * May **overshoot** the minimum, possibly **never converging**.
* **Very Small α**:

  * Model takes **forever to train**.

🔹 **Choose α wisely**: Neither too small nor too large.

---

### 📉 **Global Minimum vs Local Minimum**

* **Linear Regression** cost function is **convex**:

  * It has **only one global minimum**.
  * No issue of **local minima**.

---

### 📌 **Key Takeaways**

| Concept                          | Insight                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gradient Descent**             | Iteratively reduces cost by updating θ using the slope      |
| **Derivative = Slope**           | Guides the direction of movement towards the minimum        |
| **Positive Slope**               | θ decreases                                                 |
| **Negative Slope**               | θ increases                                                 |
| **Learning Rate (α)**            | Step size for updates; needs tuning                         |
| **Convergence**                  | Repeat updates until parameters stop changing significantly |
| **Local Minima (Deep Learning)** | Can trap updates; solved with better optimizers             |
| **Linear Regression**            | No local minima—only one global minimum                     |

Note - Convergence will stop when we come near local minima
