## AI Vs ML vs DL vs Data Science (00:01:25 )

### **1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)**  
- AI involves creating applications that perform tasks **without human intervention**.  
- Examples:  
  - **Netflix recommendations** (suggests movies based on viewing history).  
  - **Amazon product recommendations** (suggests related items like headphones after buying a phone).  
  - **Self-driving cars** (Tesla uses AI to navigate roads autonomously).  

### **2. Machine Learning (ML) – Subset of AI**  
- Provides **statistical tools** to:  
  - Analyze & visualize data.  
  - Make **predictions/forecasts** (e.g., sales forecasting, fraud detection).  
- Relies on **algorithms with statistical techniques** (e.g., regression, decision trees).  

### **3. Deep Learning (DL) – Subset of ML**  
- Mimics the **human brain** using **multi-layered neural networks**.  
- Solves **complex problems** (e.g., image recognition, speech processing).  
- Enabled breakthroughs in AI (e.g., ChatGPT, advanced computer vision).  

### **4. Data Science – The Bigger Picture**  
- A **data scientist** works across **AI, ML, and DL** depending on the business need.  
- Tasks may include:  
  - **Data analysis** (PowerBI, SQL).  
  - **ML/DL modeling** (predictive algorithms, neural networks).  
- Goal: **Build AI-driven solutions** for real-world problems.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
- **AI** → Autonomous decision-making.  
- **ML** → Stats-based predictions (subset of AI).  
- **DL** → Brain-inspired neural networks (subset of ML).  
- **Data Science** → Umbrella field combining all three for business solutions.  

- AI is a process wherein we create some kind of applications in which it will be able to do its task without any human intervention where it'll be able to make decisions and perfrom its tasks. Example - Netflix's Recommendation System, Self Driven Car (Tesla),

- Machine Learning is subset of AI where it provides stats tools to analyze the data, visualize the data and apart from that it used do predictions and forcasting.

- Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning. It's main aim is to mimic human brain so they actually create multi-layered neural network and this multi layered neural network will basically help us to train the machines or apps whatever we will try to create.

### Basic concepts of Neural Network
- A neural network is a computational model inspired by how biological neurons in the brain process information. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that can learn patterns from data.

**Basic Structure:**
- **Input Layer**: Receives data (like pixel values of an image)
- **Hidden Layer(s)**: Process and transform the data
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final result

**How it works:**
Each connection between neurons has a "weight" that determines how much influence one neuron has on another. During training, these weights are adjusted to minimize errors and improve predictions.

**Simple Examples:**

1. **Image Recognition**: A neural network can identify if an image contains a cat or dog by learning features like edges, shapes, and textures through its layers.

2. **Email Spam Detection**: The network learns to recognize patterns in email text (certain words, phrases, sender patterns) to classify emails as spam or legitimate.

3. **Handwriting Recognition**: When you write on your phone, neural networks recognize the shapes and strokes to convert your handwriting into text.

4. **Voice Assistants**: Neural networks process sound waves from your speech, convert them to text, understand the meaning, and generate appropriate responses.

The "deep" in deep learning refers to having many hidden layers (typically 3 or more), allowing the network to learn increasingly complex patterns and representations from the data.

## Machine Learning and Deep Learning (00:07:56)

1. **Supervised Machine Learning** Uses labeled training data (input-output pairs) to learn patterns and make predictions. The algorithm learns from examples where the correct answer is provided. Examples include email spam detection, image classification, and price prediction. (Uses labeled data for training)  
   - **Regression**: Predicts **continuous values** (e.g., predicting weight based on age).  
   - **Classification**: Predicts **discrete categories** (e.g., spam vs. not spam).  

2. **Unsupervised Machine Learning** Works with unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns or structures without knowing the "correct" answers. The algorithm finds relationships in data on its own. Examples include customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and data compression. (No labels, finds hidden patterns)  
   - **Clustering**: Groups similar data (e.g., customer segmentation).  
   - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces features while keeping key info (e.g., Principle Component Analysis (PCA)).

### Key Difference: 
Supervised learning learns from examples with known outcomes, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without being told what to look for. 

In case of Unsupervised learning, there is no dependent variable (output)

### **Example (Supervised Learning)**  
- **Dataset**: Age (input) → Weight (output).  
- If predicting **weight (numeric)** → **Regression**.  
- If predicting **weight category (e.g., underweight/healthy/overweight)** → **Classification**.  

- With respect to any kind of problem statement that we solve, the majority of the business use cases will be fall under two sections :-
1. Supervised ML :- In this case, we will mainly solve two major problem statements 
    - Regression problem
    - Classification 

2. Unsupervised ML :- In this case, we will solve two kind of problems :-
    - Clustering
    - Dimensionality Reduction

## Regression And Classification (00:09:05)

#### **1. Classification (Supervised ML)**  
- **Problem Type**: Predicts **categorical outcomes** (discrete labels).  
  - **Binary Classification**: 2 outcomes (e.g., Pass/Fail based on study/sleep/play hours).  
  - **Multiclass Classification**: >2 outcomes (e.g., Grades A/B/C).  
- **Example**: Predict if a student **passes/fails** using study/sleep/play data.  

#### **2. Clustering (Unsupervised ML)**  
- **Goal**: Group similar data points **without labels**.  
- **Example**: **Customer segmentation** using Salary vs. Age data.  
  - Groups: "High-income young professionals," "Middle-class," etc.  
  - **Application**: Targeted ads (e.g., luxury products for high-income clusters).  

#### **3. Dimensionality Reduction (Unsupervised ML)**  
- **Goal**: Reduce features (e.g., 1000 → 100) while retaining key info.  
- **Algorithms**: PCA (Principal Component Analysis), LDA.  
- **Use Case**: Simplifying complex datasets for faster processing.

### 📌 What is **Linear Regression**?

**Linear Regression** is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** used for **predicting a continuous numerical value** based on one or more input features.

It finds the **best-fitting straight line** (also called the **regression line**) through a set of data points. The general equation for a simple linear regression is:

$$
y = mx + c
$$

Where:

* $y$ = predicted value (dependent variable)
* $x$ = input feature (independent variable)
* $m$ = slope of the line (how much $y$ changes for a unit change in $x$)
* $c$ = intercept (value of $y$ when $x = 0$)

For **multiple linear regression**, the equation extends to:

$$
y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \dots + w_nx_n + b
$$

---

### 🎯 Why Do We Need Linear Regression?

Linear Regression is useful for:

#### ✅ 1. **Prediction**

* Predict house prices, sales, or future trends based on input features (e.g., size, location).

#### ✅ 2. **Understanding Relationships**

* Analyze how different variables relate to one another.

  > Example: How does experience affect salary?

#### ✅ 3. **Baseline Model**

* Acts as a simple and fast **benchmark model** before using complex algorithms.

#### ✅ 4. **Interpretability**

* The coefficients (slopes) in the regression equation give insight into how much each feature impacts the output.

---

### 🧠 Real-World Examples

1. **House Price Prediction**

   * Inputs: Size, number of rooms, location
   * Output: Price of the house

2. **Stock Market Forecasting**

   * Inputs: Previous stock values, volume traded
   * Output: Next day's stock price

3. **Marketing**

   * Inputs: Ad budget on platforms
   * Output: Sales/revenue generated

### 📉 Visualization (Intuition)

Given a scatter plot of points, Linear Regression finds the "best line" that minimizes the error (distance) between the line and each point (using **least squares** method).

## Linear Regression Algorithm (00:18:14)
![Linear Regression](/notes/01/01_Linear_Regression_1.1.png)

**Linear Regression Problem Statement** - Suppose we have given dataset of age (on x-axis) & weight (on y-axis) on 2D plane of XY, where we have calculated weight on the basis of age. In case of Linear Regression, we will try to find best fit line which will help us to do the predicition, i.e wrt any new age (on x-axis) what will be output (weight on y-axis). So, Y-axis (weight) is linear function of X-axis (age)

In case of Linear Regression we try to create a model with the help of training dataset, where the model (hypothesis) takes new age (independent feature) and gives the output of weight and with the help of performance metrics we try to verify whether that model is performing well or not.

### ✅ 1. **`y = mx + c`** (Standard Form in Algebra)

* **Used in:** Basic mathematics (algebra)
* **Meaning:**

  * `y` is the dependent variable.
  * `x` is the independent variable.
  * `m` is the **slope** (rate of change).
  * `c` is the **y-intercept** (value of `y` when `x = 0`).

#### 📌 Example:

Suppose we have:
`y = 2x + 3`

* This means the line has a slope `m = 2` and crosses the y-axis at `c = 3`.
* At `x = 0`: `y = 2(0) + 3 = 3`
* At `x = 1`: `y = 2(1) + 3 = 5`

---

### ✅ 2. **`y = β₀ + β₁x`** (Statistical/Regression Form)

* **Used in:** Simple Linear Regression (Statistics / Machine Learning)
* **Meaning:**

  * `β₀` is the **intercept** (like `c`)
  * `β₁` is the **coefficient** (slope, like `m`)
  * `x` is the input variable (independent variable)
  * `y` is the predicted value (dependent variable)

#### 📌 Example:

Let’s say:
`y = 1.5 + 0.8x`

* `β₀ = 1.5`, so when `x = 0`, `y = 1.5`
* `β₁ = 0.8`, which means for every increase in `x` by 1, `y` increases by 0.8.

---

### ✅ 3. **`hθ(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x`** (Hypothesis Function in Machine Learning)

In Linear Regression, the hypothesis function is the mathematical model that we use to predict the output (`y`) from a given input (`x`). The hypothesis function estimates the relationship between input and output. It tries to draw the **best-fit straight line** through the training data.

* **Used in:** Hypothesis function in **Linear Regression** (ML context)
* **Meaning:**

  * `θ₀` is the bias term (intercept)
  * `θ₁` is the weight for the input feature `x` / slope (coefficient)
  * `hθ(x)` means: the hypothesis function `h` parameterized by `θ` / predicted value (output)
  * `x` Input feature

#### 📌 Example:

Suppose we have:
`hθ(x) = 4 + 2x`

* If `x = 1`: `hθ(1) = 4 + 2(1) = 6`
* If `x = 3`: `hθ(3) = 4 + 2(3) = 10`

---

### 🎯 Summary

| Form               | Common In             | Formula              | Parameters |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------- | ---------- |
| `y = mx + c`       | Algebra               | Slope-Intercept Form | `m`, `c`   |
| `y = β₀ + β₁x`     | Statistics/Regression | Linear Regression    | `β₀`, `β₁` |
| `hθ(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x` | Machine Learning      | Hypothesis Function  | `θ₀`, `θ₁` |

They all represent the **same underlying linear relationship**, just expressed differently based on context.

![Cost function in Linear Regression](/notes/01/01_Linear_Regression_1.6.png)

In Linear Regression, the cost function measures how well your model's predictions match the actual data. It tells you how "wrong" the model is — and we try to minimize this cost to make better predictions.


### 💡 What is a Cost Function?

A **cost function** is a mathematical formula that calculates the **error** between predicted values and actual values.

For **Linear Regression**, the most commonly used cost function is:

### ✅ Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Squared Error function:

$$
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right)^2
$$

---

### 🔍 Explanation of Terms:

* `m` = number of training examples
* $h_\theta(x^{(i)})$ = predicted value (hypothesis) for the i-th example
* $y^{(i)}$ = actual value for the i-th example
* $\theta_0, \theta_1$ = model parameters (weights and bias)

The goal of training is to **find the values of** $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ that **minimize** $J(\theta)$.

---

### 📌 Example:

Let's take a small dataset:

| x (input) | y (actual) |
| --------- | ---------- |
| 1         | 2          |
| 2         | 3          |
| 3         | 5          |

Assume your model is:

$$
h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x = 0.5 + 1x
$$

Now compute predicted values:

| x | y (actual) | hθ(x) = 0.5 + 1x | Error (hθ(x) - y) | Squared Error |
| - | ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | 2          | 1.5              | -0.5              | 0.25          |
| 2 | 3          | 2.5              | -0.5              | 0.25          |
| 3 | 5          | 3.5              | -1.5              | 2.25          |

Now plug into cost function:

$$
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2 \cdot 3}(0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25) = \frac{1}{6}(2.75) \approx 0.458
$$

So, the **cost** is around **0.458**. If you change the model (adjust θ₀ and θ₁), your cost will change — and your goal is to **minimize** it!

---

### 🧠 Intuition

Think of the cost function like this:

> The lower the cost, the better your model is fitting the data.

---

## 🔹 **1. Problem Statement of Linear Regression**

* Goal: Predict a **continuous target variable `y`** (e.g., weight) based on an **independent variable `X`** (e.g., age).
* This is achieved by **fitting a straight line** through the data.
* Model is trained on a **training dataset**, then used to **predict unseen data**.

---

## 🔹 **2. Hypothesis / Model Equation**

* The linear regression model assumes the relationship:

$$
h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 \cdot x
$$
* Common notations:

  * $y = mx + c$
  * $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$
  * $h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x$

---

## 🔹 **3. Components of the Model**

### 📌 `θ₀` (Theta 0)

* **Intercept**: The value of `y` when `x = 0`
* Graphically, it is the **point where the line cuts the y-axis**

### 📌 `θ₁` (Theta 1)

* **Slope / Coefficient**: The rate at which `y` changes with `x`
* Interpreted as: **"With one unit increase in `x`, how much does `y` change?"**

---

## 🔹 **4. Goal of Linear Regression**

* To find the **best fit line** such that:

  * The **distance between actual values (`y`) and predicted values (`hθ(x)`) is minimized**
* This is measured using a **cost function**.

---

## 🔹 **5. Cost Function (Squared Error Function)**

* Formula:

$$
J(\theta_0, \theta_1) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2
$$

### Key Points:

* $h_\theta(x)$: Prediction from the model.
* $y$: Actual value from the dataset.
* $m$: Number of training examples.
* **Why square the errors?**

  * To avoid cancellation of positive and negative errors.
* **Why divide by 2m?**

  * `1/m` gives average.
  * `1/2` simplifies derivative calculations in **Gradient Descent**.

---

## 🔹 **6. Error Minimization**

* The aim is to **find values of θ₀ and θ₁** that **minimize** the cost function.
* This is where **optimization algorithms** like **Gradient Descent** are used.

---

## 🔹 **7. Visual Intuition with Example**

* Example Dataset: $(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)$
* Trying different values of θ₁:

  * **θ₁ = 1**: Perfect fit (all points lie on line), **cost = 0**
  * **θ₁ = 0.5**: Worse fit, cost ≈ 0.58
  * **θ₁ = 0**: Worst fit, cost ≈ 2.3

---
![Graph of cost function vs slope (θ₁)](/notes/01/01_Linear_Regression_1.11.png)

## 🔹 **8. Cost Function Plot (J vs θ₁)**

* Graph of cost function vs slope (θ₁) shows a **U-shaped curve**
* Lowest point is the **Global Minimum**

  * At this point, **J(θ₀, θ₁)** is the smallest
  * This value of θ₁ gives the **best fit line**

---

## 🔹 **9. Gradient Descent (Optimization Approach)**

* **Iteratively updates** θ₀ and θ₁ to move **towards the global minimum**
* Update rule:

$$
\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} J(\theta_0, \theta_1)
$$

  * $\alpha$: Learning rate
  * $\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j}$: Partial derivative with respect to θ₀ or θ₁

## 🔁 **Gradient Descent & Convergence Algorithm in Linear Regression**

### 🧠 **Motivation**

* Instead of **randomly assuming values** of parameters like θ₁ (theta₁), we want a **systematic way** to **reach the global minimum** of the cost function (J).
* To achieve this, we use an **iterative optimization technique** called **Gradient Descent**.

---

### 📉 **Cost Function Recap**

* The **cost function (J(θ₀, θ₁))** is a **U-shaped curve** (for linear regression).
* Our goal is to **minimize this cost** by updating θ₀ and θ₁.
* The **global minimum** is the lowest point on this curve.

---

### 🔁 **Convergence Algorithm (Gradient Descent Update Rule)**

#### 🔹 Repeat Until Convergence:

```text
θj := θj - α * ∂/∂θj ( J(θ₀, θ₁) )
```

Where:

* **θj** is the parameter to be updated (e.g., θ₀ or θ₁)
* **α** is the **learning rate**
* **∂/∂θj J(θ₀, θ₁)** is the **derivative** (slope) of the cost function with respect to θj

---

### 📐 **Derivative (Slope) Intuition**

* **Positive Slope** → Move **left** (decrease θ)
* **Negative Slope** → Move **right** (increase θ)
* The **slope** (gradient) tells us the **direction and magnitude** of update needed.

---

### ⚙️ **Learning Rate (α)**

* Controls the **step size** of each update.
* **Small α (e.g., 0.01)**:

  * Takes **small steps**, converges slowly, but **stable**.
* **Large α (e.g., 1)**:

  * May **overshoot** the minimum, possibly **never converging**.
* **Very Small α**:

  * Model takes **forever to train**.

🔹 **Choose α wisely**: Neither too small nor too large.

---

### 📉 **Global Minimum vs Local Minimum**

* **Linear Regression** cost function is **convex**:

  * It has **only one global minimum**.
  * No issue of **local minima**.

---

### 📌 **Key Takeaways**

| Concept                          | Insight                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gradient Descent**             | Iteratively reduces cost by updating θ using the slope      |
| **Derivative = Slope**           | Guides the direction of movement towards the minimum        |
| **Positive Slope**               | θ decreases                                                 |
| **Negative Slope**               | θ increases                                                 |
| **Learning Rate (α)**            | Step size for updates; needs tuning                         |
| **Convergence**                  | Repeat updates until parameters stop changing significantly |
| **Local Minima (Deep Learning)** | Can trap updates; solved with better optimizers             |
| **Linear Regression**            | No local minima—only one global minimum                     |

---

### 🔵 "Cost Function is Convex" — What Does It Mean?

A **convex function** is a function that curves upwards like a **U-shape**. It has the following properties:

* ✅ Only **one global minimum** (the lowest point).
* ❌ **No local minima** (no other dips or valleys).

So when we try to **minimize the cost** using an optimization algorithm (like gradient descent), we are guaranteed to reach the **global minimum** — the point where our model performs best.

---

### 📈 Visual Intuition:

Imagine a bowl. The bottom of the bowl is the **global minimum**. No matter where you start rolling a ball inside the bowl, it will always end up at the bottom.

That’s what happens with the **cost function in linear regression** — it’s shaped like that bowl.

---

### 🧠 Example:

Let’s say you’re trying different values of $\theta_1$ (the slope) while keeping $\theta_0$ fixed.

You compute cost $J(\theta_1)$ for each value and plot the curve.

You get something like this:

```
Cost (J)
 |
 |                ●
 |            ●
 |        ●
 |    ●
 |●_____________________ θ₁ (slope)
```

This is a **convex curve** — a smooth U-shape. The **lowest point** gives the **best value** of $\theta_1$ that minimizes the prediction error.

---

### 🔑 Why It Matters:

In some machine learning algorithms (like neural networks), the cost function **is not convex** — it can have **many local minima**, so optimization becomes tricky.

But in **linear regression**, the cost function is **always convex**, so:

* ✔ We can safely use gradient descent.
* ✔ We’ll always converge to the best solution.
* ✔ No fear of getting stuck in a bad minimum.

---

### ✅ Summary:

> When we say “**Linear Regression cost function is convex**,” we mean it has a nice U-shape that ensures:
>
> * There is **only one best solution** (global minimum).
> * Optimization (e.g., gradient descent) is **simple and reliable**.


🔸 Convergence stops when gradient descent reaches (or comes very close to) the global minimum of the cost function.

---

### ✅ **1. Gradient Descent Algorithm**

**Purpose:**
To minimize the cost function (loss) by iteratively updating the model parameters (θ₀, θ₁).

#### 🔁 Repeat until convergence:

Update each parameter `θⱼ` as:

$$
\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} J(\theta_0, \theta_1)
$$

Where:

* $\alpha$ = learning rate (e.g., 0.01 or 0.1)
* $J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$ = cost function

---

### ✅ **2. Cost Function (Mean Squared Error)**

Used to measure the performance of the hypothesis:

$$
J(\theta_0, \theta_1) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2
$$

Where:

* $m$ = number of training examples
* $h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 \cdot x$

---

### ✅ **3. Derivatives for Gradient Descent Updates**

#### ➤ Derivative w\.r.t. $\theta_0$:

$$
\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_0} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})
$$

#### ➤ Derivative w\.r.t. $\theta_1$:

$$
\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_1} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \cdot x^{(i)}
$$

---

### **Maths behind Derivatives for Gradient Descent Updates** 

#### 🔶 1. **Cost Function** (Mean Squared Error):

$$
J(\theta_0, \theta_1) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left(h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}\right)^2
$$

Where:

* $h_\theta(x^{(i)}) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x^{(i)}$
* $y^{(i)}$ is the actual output for the $i^\text{th}$ training example
* $m$ is the number of training examples

---

#### 🔶 2. **Goal: Compute the partial derivative** of the cost function w\.r.t. $\theta_j$

We want:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} J(\theta_0, \theta_1)
$$

Let’s expand the cost function inside the derivative:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} \left[ \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( \theta_0 + \theta_1 x^{(i)} - y^{(i)} \right)^2 \right]
$$

---

#### 🔶 3. **Use the chain rule** to differentiate:

Let’s define:

$$
E^{(i)} = \left( h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right) = \left( \theta_0 + \theta_1 x^{(i)} - y^{(i)} \right)
$$

Now the cost function becomes:

$$
J(\theta_0, \theta_1) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( E^{(i)} \right)^2
$$

Now, apply the derivative:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} 2 E^{(i)} \cdot \frac{\partial E^{(i)}}{\partial \theta_j}
$$

Cancel out 2 from numerator and denominator:

$$
= \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} E^{(i)} \cdot \frac{\partial E^{(i)}}{\partial \theta_j}
$$

---

#### 🔶 4. **Now compute $\frac{\partial E^{(i)}}{\partial \theta_j}$**

Recall:

* $E^{(i)} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x^{(i)} - y^{(i)}$

So:

* $\frac{\partial E^{(i)}}{\partial \theta_0} = 1$
* $\frac{\partial E^{(i)}}{\partial \theta_1} = x^{(i)}$

---

### **Differntiation step by step** : Step 4 in details

#### 🔶 Step 4: Compute

$$
\frac{\partial E^{(i)}}{\partial \theta_j}
$$

We need this as part of the chain rule used in the derivative of the cost function.

### ✅ Recall:

We defined the error for the $i^\text{th}$ training example as:

$$
E^{(i)} = h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x^{(i)} - y^{(i)}
$$

We want to compute:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} E^{(i)} \quad \text{(where } j = 0 \text{ or } 1\text{)}
$$

---

### 📌 Case 1: $\theta_j = \theta_0$

$$
E^{(i)} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x^{(i)} - y^{(i)}
$$

Differentiate with respect to $\theta_0$:

$$
\frac{\partial E^{(i)}}{\partial \theta_0} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_0}(\theta_0 + \theta_1 x^{(i)} - y^{(i)}) = 1 + 0 - 0 = \boxed{1}
$$

* $\theta_0$ → derivative is 1
* $\theta_1 x^{(i)}$ → constant w\.r.t $\theta_0$, so derivative is 0
* $y^{(i)}$ → actual value, constant, so derivative is 0

---

### 📌 Case 2: $\theta_j = \theta_1$

$$
E^{(i)} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x^{(i)} - y^{(i)}
$$

Differentiate with respect to $\theta_1$:

$$
\frac{\partial E^{(i)}}{\partial \theta_1} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_1}(\theta_0 + \theta_1 x^{(i)} - y^{(i)}) = 0 + x^{(i)} - 0 = \boxed{x^{(i)}}
$$

* $\theta_0$ → derivative is 0
* $\theta_1 x^{(i)}$ → derivative is $x^{(i)}$
* $y^{(i)}$ → constant → derivative is 0

---

### ✅ So final results:

$$
\frac{\partial E^{(i)}}{\partial \theta_0} = 1
$$

$$
\frac{\partial E^{(i)}}{\partial \theta_1} = x^{(i)}
$$


> We differentiated the error term $E^{(i)} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x^{(i)} - y^{(i)}$ with respect to both $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$, applying basic derivative rules. These derivatives are essential components of the gradient of the cost function.

---

## 🔶 5. Final Derivatives:

### ✅ For $\theta_0$:

$$
\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_0} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right)
$$

### ✅ For $\theta_1$:

$$
\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_1} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right) \cdot x^{(i)}
$$

---

## 🔁 These are used in **Gradient Descent**:

$$
\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} J(\theta)
$$

Where $\alpha$ is the learning rate.

---

### ✅ **4. Final Gradient Descent Update Equations**

$$
\theta_0 := \theta_0 - \alpha \cdot \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})
$$

$$
\theta_1 := \theta_1 - \alpha \cdot \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \cdot x^{(i)}
$$

---

### ✅ **5. Hypothesis Function**

The predicted value:

$$
h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 \cdot x
$$

---

### ✅ **6. Convergence in Gradient Descent**

* **Convergence stops** when updates to $\theta_0$, $\theta_1$ become negligible, i.e., cost function $J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$ flattens out.
* This means you're **near the global minimum** (as the cost function is **convex** for linear regression).

---

## 🔍 **R² (R-Squared) — Coefficient of Determination**

### ✅ **Definition:**

R² measures how well the regression model explains the variability of the dependent variable `y`.

### ✅ **Formula:**

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2}
$$

* $\hat{y}_i$: Predicted value from model
* $y_i$: Actual value
* $\bar{y}$: Mean of actual `y` values

### ✅ **Interpretation:**

* R² = 0 → Model explains none of the variance
* R² = 1 → Model perfectly explains the variance
* R² can be **negative** → Indicates the model is worse than just using the mean ($\bar{y}$).

### ✅ **Behavior:**

* **Always increases** or stays the same when you add more features — even irrelevant ones.

---

## 🎯 **Adjusted R² — Penalized R²**

### ✅ **Purpose:**

To correct the flaw of R² increasing with added features — by penalizing the model for **adding non-useful features**.

### ✅ **Formula:**

$$
R^2_{\text{adj}} = 1 - \left(1 - R^2\right) \cdot \frac{n - 1}{n - p - 1}
$$

* $n$: Number of observations (data points)
* $p$: Number of predictors/features

### ✅ **Behavior:**

* **Increases** only if the new feature improves the model more than by chance.
* **Decreases** if the feature is not useful.
* **Always ≤ R²**

---

## 📌 **Key Insights & Takeaways**

| Concept                               | R² | Adjusted R² |
| ------------------------------------- | -- | ----------- |
| Measures model fit                    | ✅  | ✅           |
| Always increases with added features  | ✅  | ❌           |

| Better for multiple linear regression | ❌  | ✅           |
| Preferred for feature comparison      | ❌  | ✅           |

---

## 🧠 **Examples and Scenarios**

* You have features:
  `bedrooms` → good predictor
  `location` → strong predictor
  `gender of occupant` → irrelevant to house price

| Features Used | R² (%) | Adjusted R² (%) |
| ------------- | ------ | --------------- |
| Bedrooms only | 85     | 84              |
| + Location    | 90     | 89              |
| + Gender      | 91     | 82 (**↓**)      |

Even though R² increased to 91%, **Adjusted R² dropped**, signaling that **gender** was not a helpful feature.

## 🎤 **Common Interview Q\&A**

## Ridge And Lasso Regression Algorithms (01:07:14)

**Overfitting** - When Model performs well with training data but failed to perform well with test data.

**Underfitting** - When Model accuracy is bad with training data as well as model accuracy is also bad with test data then this scenario is known as Underfitting.

---

## ✅ **1. Linear Regression Overview**

* A **supervised learning algorithm** used for **predicting continuous output**.
* The hypothesis function (prediction equation):

$$
h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x
$$
* Goal: Minimize the difference between predicted and actual values.

---

## ✅ **2. Cost Function (Mean Squared Error - MSE)**

* Measures error between predicted and actual values:

$$
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2
$$
* Convex in nature ⇒ only one global minimum.

---

## ✅ **3. Gradient Descent**

* Optimization technique to **minimize cost function**.
* Iteratively updates θ values using derivatives:

$$
\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta_j}
$$
* **α**: learning rate.
* **Convergence** stops when cost function change is negligible.

---

## ✅ **4. Overfitting vs Underfitting vs Generalization**

| **Scenario**          | **Training Accuracy** | **Test Accuracy** | **Bias** | **Variance** | **Conclusion**                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | -------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Overfitting**       | High                  | Low               | Low      | High         | Model memorized training data, poor on unseen data. |
| **Underfitting**      | Low                   | Low               | High     | High         | Model failed to learn patterns at all.              |
| **Generalized Model** | High (\~)             | High (\~)         | Low      | Low          | Balanced learning, good generalization.             |

### ➤ **Key Points:**

* **Bias** = error on training data.
* **Variance** = sensitivity to test/unseen data.
* Generalization is the ideal state of a model.

---

## ✅ **5. R² and Adjusted R²**

* **R² (Coefficient of Determination)**: Proportion of variance explained by the model.

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{\text{res}}}{SS_{\text{tot}}}
$$
* **Adjusted R²**: Corrects R² for multiple features:

$$
\text{Adjusted } R^2 = 1 - \left(1 - R^2\right)\frac{n - 1}{n - k - 1}
$$

  Where `n` = #samples, `k` = #features

---

## ✅ **6. Regularization**

Used to **prevent overfitting** by **penalizing large weights (θ values)**.

### ➤ **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**

* Adds squared penalty term to cost function:

$$
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum (y^{(i)} - h_\theta(x^{(i)}))^2 + \lambda \sum \theta_j^2
$$
* Penalizes **large θ values**, smoothens the curve → better generalization.

### ➤ **Intuition:**

* Keeps the slope of the line from becoming too steep (which often causes overfitting).
* Forces model to **not fit training data perfectly**, hence improving performance on test data.

### ➤ **Key Term:**

* **λ (lambda)**: regularization strength (hyperparameter)

  * High λ → more penalty → can cause underfitting
  * Low λ → less penalty → can still overfit

---

## ✅ **7. Convergence & Iterations**

* **Convergence**: when updates to θ become minimal, cost function stabilizes.
* **Iteration**: each update step in gradient descent.
* More iterations → better approximation (up to a point).

---

## ✅ **8. Important Intuitions & Tips**

* A perfect zero cost (J(θ) = 0) often signals **overfitting**, not perfection.
* **Training vs Test Data:**

  * High training accuracy and low test accuracy ⇒ Overfitting.
  * Low both ⇒ Underfitting.
* **Slope (θ₁) steepness**: Steeper slope can mean high variance.
* **Hyperparameters** like learning rate (α), λ (in Ridge), and #iterations directly affect performance.
* Regularization encourages **simpler models** that **generalize better**.

---

## ✅ **9. Visual Understanding**

* Overfitting: curve fits all training points exactly ⇒ high test error.
* Underfitting: model doesn’t capture pattern at all ⇒ high training and test error.
* Generalized: balances fit on training & test data ⇒ best performance.

---

## ✅ Summary in One Line:

> **Linear regression aims to learn the best-fit line minimizing error. But without regularization, it risks overfitting; using techniques like Ridge (L2) ensures better generalization.**

---

**Regularization** adds a penalty term to the loss function (cost function) to discourage the model from fitting the noise in the training data.

## 📌 **1. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**

### 🔷 **Formula (Cost Function)**:

$$
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{n} |\theta_j|
$$

### 🔷 **Key Concepts**:

* **Adds penalty**: The **absolute value of coefficients (|θ|)**.
* **Purpose**:

  * Prevent **overfitting**.
  * Perform **feature selection** by shrinking less useful feature coefficients to **zero**.
* **Outcome**:

  * Automatically drops **irrelevant features** (coefficients become exactly zero).
  * **Sparse models** (few features retained).
* **Why |θ| helps in feature selection?**

  * Unlike L2 (which squares θ), L1 prefers sparse weights.
  * Forces some θ values to become zero when λ is large enough.

✅ When to Use Lasso?
- When you have many features, but only a few are important
- You want to do feature selection automatically
- You want a sparse model (i.e., with fewer non-zero coefficients)

---

## 📌 **2. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**

### 🔷 **Formula (Cost Function)**:

$$
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2
$$

### 🔷 **Key Concepts**:

* Adds penalty as **square of the coefficients (θ²)**.
* **Purpose**:

  * Prevent **overfitting**.
  * Useful when features are correlated but we don’t want to eliminate them completely.
* Coefficients are **shrunk**, but not exactly zero (no feature selection).
* Ridge regression is helpful when **all features** are relevant but need to **control their influence**.

✅ When to Use Ridge?
- When all features are useful
- When features are correlated
- You want to reduce model complexity without removing features
---

## 📌 **3. Comparison: Lasso vs Ridge**

| Aspect                | Lasso (L1)              | Ridge (L2)                             |   |                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | - | ----------------------- |
| Regularization Term   | ( \lambda \sum          | \theta                                 | ) | $\lambda \sum \theta^2$ |
| Feature Selection     | ✅ Yes (some θ become 0) | ❌ No                                   |   |                         |
| Coefficient Shrinkage | ✅ Strong                | ✅ Mild                                 |   |                         |
| Use Case              | Few important features  | All features matter, multicollinearity |   |                         |

---

## 📌 **4. Lambda (λ) — Regularization Parameter**

* Controls the **strength of penalty**.
* **Higher λ** → More shrinkage (simpler model).
* Chosen via **cross-validation** (e.g. Grid Search CV).
* **Goal**: Balance bias and variance, minimize the validation error.

---

## 📌 **5. Cross Validation**

* Used to:

  * Tune hyperparameters (like λ).
  * Evaluate model performance reliably.
* Splits dataset into **training and validation sets multiple times**.
* Popular method: **k-Fold Cross Validation**.

---

## 📌 **6. Assumptions of Linear Regression**

### ✅ **A. Linearity**

* Relationship between input `X` and output `y` is **linear**.
* Use scatter plots or residual plots to check.

### ✅ **B. Normality of Features**

* Features ideally follow **Gaussian distribution**.
* If not, apply **feature transformation**:

  * Log, square root, Box-Cox, etc.

### ✅ **C. Standardization (Z-score scaling)**

* Important when using **Gradient Descent** or **Regularization**.
* Formula:

$$
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

  * Mean = 0, Std Dev = 1
* Helps gradient descent converge faster by normalizing feature scales.

### ✅ **D. Multicollinearity**

* **Highly correlated features** (e.g., X1 and X2 are 95% similar).
* Causes instability in model interpretation and coefficient values.
* Solution:

  * Drop one of the highly correlated features.
  * Use **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** to detect multicollinearity.

### ✅ **E. Homoscedasticity**

* Variance of errors should be **constant across all levels** of input variables.
* Opposite of **heteroscedasticity** (which breaks this assumption).

---

## 📌 **7. Additional Concepts**

* **Feature Selection**: Handled well by Lasso.
* **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**:

  * Regularization helps reduce **variance** without increasing bias too much.
* **Gradient Descent**:

  * Optimization algorithm to minimize cost.
  * Works best with **scaled** features.

## ✅ Setup: Toy Dataset - Example of Ridge and Lasso Regression

We’ll use a very small dataset to simplify calculations.

### Suppose we have:

| x | y |
| - | - |
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 4 |

We want to fit a **linear model**:

$$
\hat{y} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x
$$

Let’s ignore bias $\theta_0$ (for simplicity) and fit:

$$
\hat{y} = \theta_1 x
$$

---

## 🔷 1. RIDGE REGRESSION (L2): Step-by-Step

### 📌 Goal:

Minimize the cost function:

$$
J(\theta_1) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \theta_1 x_i)^2 + \lambda \theta_1^2
$$

We’ll calculate for $\lambda = 1$

---

## 🔽 Step-by-step

### 🧮 Step 1: Compute squared error loss

$$
J(\theta_1) = (2 - \theta_1 \cdot 1)^2 + (3 - \theta_1 \cdot 2)^2 + (4 - \theta_1 \cdot 3)^2 + 1 \cdot \theta_1^2
$$

Now expand each term:

* First term: $(2 - \theta_1)^2 = 4 - 4\theta_1 + \theta_1^2$
* Second: $(3 - 2\theta_1)^2 = 9 - 12\theta_1 + 4\theta_1^2$
* Third: $(4 - 3\theta_1)^2 = 16 - 24\theta_1 + 9\theta_1^2$
* Ridge penalty: $+ \theta_1^2$

Now sum them:

$$
J(\theta_1) = (4 + 9 + 16) - (4 + 12 + 24)\theta_1 + (1 + 4 + 9 + 1)\theta_1^2
$$

$$
= 29 - 40\theta_1 + 15\theta_1^2
$$

---

### 🔍 Step 2: Minimize cost

To minimize $J(\theta_1) = 29 - 40\theta_1 + 15\theta_1^2$, take derivative and set to 0:

$$
\frac{dJ}{d\theta_1} = -40 + 30\theta_1 = 0
$$

$$
\Rightarrow \theta_1 = \frac{40}{30} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33
$$

---

### 🎯 Final Ridge Model:

$$
\hat{y} = 1.33 \cdot x
$$

Compare this with **ordinary least squares (OLS)**:

* If no penalty: $\theta_1 = 1.4$
* Ridge shrinks it slightly → $\theta_1 = 1.33$

---

## 🟨 2. LASSO REGRESSION (L1): Step-by-Step

### 📌 Goal:

Minimize the cost function:

$$
J(\theta_1) = \sum (y_i - \theta_1 x_i)^2 + \lambda |\theta_1|
$$

Again use $\lambda = 1$

---

## ⚠️ Challenge:

The absolute value $|\theta_1|$ makes the function **non-differentiable at 0**, so we can’t use regular calculus like with Ridge. Instead, we use **subgradients** or try piecewise analysis.

---

### 🧮 Step 1: Use same data as above

The squared error part:

$$
S(\theta_1) = 29 - 40\theta_1 + 14\theta_1^2 \quad \text{(without penalty)}
$$

Now add the Lasso penalty:

$$
J(\theta_1) = 29 - 40\theta_1 + 14\theta_1^2 + |\theta_1|
$$

---

### ⚖️ Step 2: Piecewise derivative

#### Case 1: $\theta_1 > 0$

$$
\frac{dJ}{d\theta_1} = -40 + 28\theta_1 + 1
= -39 + 28\theta_1
\Rightarrow 28\theta_1 = 39 \Rightarrow \theta_1 = \frac{39}{28} \approx 1.39
$$

#### Case 2: $\theta_1 < 0$

$$
\frac{dJ}{d\theta_1} = -40 + 28\theta_1 - 1 = -41 + 28\theta_1
\Rightarrow 28\theta_1 = 41 \Rightarrow \theta_1 = \frac{41}{28} \approx 1.46 \text{ (But negative)}
$$

That’s invalid for $\theta_1 < 0$

So optimal solution is:

$$
\theta_1 \approx 1.39
$$

✅ Still close to OLS (1.4), but **Lasso tends to zero out coefficients** in high-dimensional data (this toy data doesn’t need it yet).

---

## 🧠 BONUS: Why Lasso Can Become 0?

Imagine if $\theta_1$ was small (like 0.01). Then:

* Ridge penalty: $(0.01)^2 = 0.0001$
* Lasso penalty: $|0.01| = 0.01$

👉 Lasso adds **stronger penalty** near 0 → it's **more likely to push small values exactly to 0**.

## Logistic Regression Algorithm (01:33:08)

Logistic Regression works very well with binary classification.

---

## 🔶 **Summary: Logistic Regression vs Linear Regression for Classification**

### ✅ **Scenario Setup**

* We are working on a **classification problem**, not regression.
* **Features**: `study_hours`, `play_hours`
* **Target**: Predict whether the child **Passes (1)** or **Fails (0)\`** → This is a **binary classification problem**.

---

## 📉 Why Not Use Linear Regression for Classification?

### 🔹 **Linear Regression Attempt**

* Linear regression tries to draw a **best-fit line**.
* Assumes **continuous output**, but we need **discrete categories** (Pass/Fail).
* Idea: Use output of linear regression as a threshold:

  * If `hθ(x) < 0.5` → Fail (0)
  * If `hθ(x) ≥ 0.5` → Pass (1)

### ⚠️ **Problems with Linear Regression in Classification**

1. **Sensitive to Outliers**:

   * Outliers can **shift the regression line**, leading to **wrong classifications**.
   * Example: One student with 9 study hours fails → Line shifts, now even 5-hour students might be predicted to fail.

2. **No Probability Interpretation**:

   * Linear regression can give values < 0 or > 1.
   * But classification should produce values **strictly between 0 and 1**, to be interpreted as **probabilities**.

3. **Unbounded Output**:

   * Linear regression is not bounded between \[0, 1].
   * Example: A student with 0 study hours might result in prediction of -0.3 (invalid), or with 20 hours, might give 1.7 (again invalid).

---

## ✅ **Logistic Regression as a Solution**

### 🔹 Key Idea:

* Use a **sigmoid function** to **squash the linear line** into a **range between 0 and 1**.
* Logistic regression still uses a linear combination (`θᵀx`) but applies a **non-linear transformation** to it.

### 📌 **Sigmoid Function**:

$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
$$

Where $z = \theta^T x$

* Output: always between **0 and 1**.
* Interpreted as **probability** of belonging to class **1 (Pass)**.
* Decision Rule:

  * If $\sigma(z) ≥ 0.5$ → Class = 1 (Pass)
  * If $\sigma(z) < 0.5$ → Class = 0 (Fail)

## 📌 Visual Recap

1. **Linear Regression Fit** (Fails for classification):

   * Predicts values like -0.3, 0.7, 1.5
   * Gets distorted with outliers

2. **Logistic Regression Fit**:

   * Predicts values between 0 and 1
   * Sigmoid curve gives natural separation between classes

---

## 🔷 **Logistic Regression: Overview**

* **Logistic Regression** is used for **binary classification** problems.
* Instead of predicting continuous output (like in Linear Regression), it predicts **probabilities between 0 and 1**, mapping them to two classes (e.g., Pass/Fail, Yes/No, 0/1).

---

## 🔶 **Hypothesis Function in Logistic Regression**

We first define a **linear combination** of input features:

$$
z = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \theta_n x_n = \theta^T x
$$

This linear function is then **passed through a sigmoid function** to squash the result between 0 and 1.

---

## 🔸 **Sigmoid Function (a.k.a Logistic Function)**

The **sigmoid function** is defined as:

$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
$$

So the hypothesis for Logistic Regression becomes:

$$
h_\theta(x) = \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\theta^T x)}}
$$

---

![Sigmoid Function Graph](/notes/03/02_Decision_Boundary_of_Logistic_Regression-1.3.png)

## 🔸 **Graphical Interpretation of the Sigmoid Function**

* The sigmoid function outputs values between **0 and 1**.
* The curve is **S-shaped** (sigmoid curve).
* At `z = 0`, output is `0.5`.
* As `z → ∞`, output → 1.
* As `z → -∞`, output → 0.

This makes it suitable for **probabilistic binary classification**.

---

## ✅ **Important Property for Classification:**

* When $h_\theta(x) \geq 0.5$, predict class **1**
* When $h_\theta(x) < 0.5$, predict class **0**

This leads to a **decision boundary** at:

$$
\theta^T x = 0
$$

This is a **linear boundary** in the input feature space.

---

## 🔷 **Decision Boundary in Logistic Regression**

* The decision boundary is **not the sigmoid curve** itself.
* It is the **line (or surface in higher dimensions)** where $h_\theta(x) = 0.5$.
* This simplifies to solving:

$$
\theta^T x = 0
$$

It divides the feature space into two halves — one predicting 1 and the other predicting 0.

## **More about Decision Boundary in Logistic Regression**

Concept of a **decision boundary in logistic regression**, **why it is not the sigmoid curve**, and why we solve for:

$$
\theta^T x = 0
$$

## 🔷 What is a Decision Boundary in Logistic Regression?

### ✅ Logistic Regression Overview

Logistic regression is used for **binary classification** — it predicts whether an input belongs to class **1** or **0**.

We calculate the **probability** that a given input `x` belongs to class 1 using the **sigmoid function**:

$$
h_\theta(x) = \sigma(\theta^T x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\theta^T x}}
$$

* $\theta$ = model parameters (weights + bias)
* $x$ = feature vector
* $h_\theta(x)$ = probability that the label is 1

---

### ✅ But What Is the Decision Boundary?

* The **sigmoid** output $h_\theta(x)$ is a value between **0 and 1**.
* We **classify** as 1 if:

$$
h_\theta(x) \geq 0.5
$$

  and as 0 if:

$$
h_\theta(x) < 0.5
$$

👉 So the **decision boundary** is the region where:

$$
h_\theta(x) = 0.5
$$

Let’s plug this into the sigmoid equation:

$$
\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\theta^T x}} = 0.5
$$

Solve it:

$$
1 + e^{-\theta^T x} = 2 \Rightarrow e^{-\theta^T x} = 1 \Rightarrow -\theta^T x = 0 \Rightarrow \theta^T x = 0
$$

✅ **Therefore, the decision boundary is the set of points where**:

$$
\theta^T x = 0
$$

---

### 🔶 Why Is It Called a "Boundary"?

This equation $\theta^T x = 0$ defines a **hyperplane** (a line in 2D, a plane in 3D, etc.) that **divides the input space**:

* **One side** gives $h_\theta(x) > 0.5$ → Predict class **1**
* **Other side** gives $h_\theta(x) < 0.5$ → Predict class **0**

---

## 📌 Example (2D Case)

Let’s say:

$$
\theta = [-3, 1, 1] \quad \text{(i.e., bias = -3, weights for x1 and x2 are 1)}
$$

So:

$$
\theta^T x = -3 + x_1 + x_2
$$

Set decision boundary:

$$
-3 + x_1 + x_2 = 0 \Rightarrow x_1 + x_2 = 3
$$

This is a **line** in 2D space. It separates the feature space into:

* **Above the line** (e.g., $x_1 + x_2 > 3$) → class 1
* **Below the line** (e.g., $x_1 + x_2 < 3$) → class 0

## 📌 Visual Intuition (2D)

Imagine a graph:

* X-axis: Feature 1
* Y-axis: Feature 2
* The line $x_1 + x_2 = 3$ splits the space.
* Points on one side → label 1 (green), other side → label 0 (red)

---

## 📌 **Why Not Just Use Linear Regression?**

* Linear regression outputs are **not bounded**, so predictions can be < 0 or > 1.
* Logistic regression ensures **bounded probabilities** using the **sigmoid squashing**.

---

## 🔸 **Why "Logistic" Regression?**

* The model starts with a **linear regression** base.
* It then applies the **logistic (sigmoid) transformation** to squash the output between 0 and 1.
* Hence, it’s called **logistic regression**, even though the output is **classification**, not regression.

---

## 🔶 **Does Sigmoid Squashing Help with Outliers?**

Yes, to some extent:

* The sigmoid function **compresses large values** of z into a range close to 0 or 1.
* This **reduces the influence of extreme feature values** (outliers) on the output prediction.

---

## ✅ Why Do We Use the **Sigmoid Function** in Logistic Regression?

### 1. **To Convert Linear Output into a Probability**

In Logistic Regression, we start with a **linear model**:

$$
z = \theta^T x = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \theta_n x_n
$$

This value `z` can be **any real number**, from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$. But for **classification**, especially binary classification, we need a **probability output between 0 and 1**.

So, we **apply the sigmoid function**:

$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
$$

This transforms `z` into a value between 0 and 1 — interpreted as the **probability that the output belongs to class 1**.

---

### 2. **To Define a Clear Decision Threshold**

The sigmoid function is centered around **0**:

* If $z = 0$, then $\sigma(z) = 0.5$
* If $z > 0$, then $\sigma(z) > 0.5$ → Predict class 1
* If $z < 0$, then $\sigma(z) < 0.5$ → Predict class 0

So, the sigmoid enables us to use a **natural decision boundary** at 0.5 (or at $\theta^T x = 0$).

---

### 3. **To Enable Use of Log Loss (Cross-Entropy Loss)**

The output of the sigmoid becomes a probability, which allows us to compute the **log loss function** used to train logistic regression:

$$
J(\theta) = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left[ y^{(i)} \log h_\theta(x^{(i)}) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \log(1 - h_\theta(x^{(i)})) \right]
$$

This loss function works **only when the prediction $h_\theta(x)$** is between 0 and 1 — which the sigmoid guarantees.

---

## 🎯 Real-Life Use Cases of Logistic Regression with Sigmoid Function

| Use Case                   | Explanation                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Email Spam Detection** | Predict whether an email is spam (1) or not (0) based on text features |
| ✅ **Credit Scoring**       | Estimate the probability of loan default (1 = default, 0 = no default) |
| ✅ **Medical Diagnosis**    | Predict presence/absence of disease based on symptoms/lab tests        |

| ✅ **Ad Click Prediction**  | Estimate probability of a user clicking on an ad (CTR models)          |
| ✅ **Fraud Detection**      | Predict if a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0)           |

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

* **Why sigmoid?** To map any real-valued number into a **probability (0–1)**.
* It enables classification, **interpretable decision boundaries**, and **probabilistic predictions**.
* **Logistic Regression + Sigmoid** = a powerful, interpretable binary classifier.

---

## 🔷 **1. Problem Setup**

We start with a **binary classification** problem:

* Dataset:
  $\{(x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}), (x^{(2)}, y^{(2)}), \ldots, (x^{(n)}, y^{(n)})\}$
* Labels:
  $y^{(i)} \in \{0, 1\}$

---

## 🔷 **2. Hypothesis Function in Logistic Regression**

Instead of a linear hypothesis, we use the **sigmoid function**:

$$
h_\theta(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\theta^T x}} \quad \text{where } \theta^T x = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \ldots + \theta_n x_n
$$

This **compresses output** to a probability between **0 and 1**.

---

## 🔷 **3. Initial (Wrong) Cost Function from Linear Regression**

Recall cost in linear regression:

$$
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^m (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2
$$

> ❌ **Issue:** Using this with sigmoid makes cost function **non-convex**. Gradient descent can get stuck in **local minima**.

---

## 🔷 **4. Why Convexity Matters**

### ✅ Convex Function:

* One **global minimum**
* Gradient descent always converges (parabola-like)

### ❌ Non-Convex Function:

* **Multiple local minima**
* Gradient descent may **not converge**

Using squared loss with a sigmoid activation results in **non-convex** cost — hence not suitable.

---

## 🔷 **5. Logistic Regression Cost Function (Correct Approach)**

To solve this, a **new cost function** is used, based on **log-likelihood** and designed to be convex:

### For a single training example:

$$
\text{Cost}(h_\theta(x), y) = 
\begin{cases}
\log(h_\theta(x)) & \text{if } y = 1 \\
\log(1 - h_\theta(x)) & \text{if } y = 0
\end{cases}
$$

We can combine both cases into a **single equation**:

$$
\text{Cost}(h_\theta(x), y) = -y \log(h_\theta(x)) - (1 - y) \log(1 - h_\theta(x))
$$

### Derivation of Logistic Regression Cost function

#### 🔷 Goal of the Cost Function

In **logistic regression**, the hypothesis $h_\theta(x)$ outputs a probability (between 0 and 1), indicating the chance that the output $y = 1$.

We want a cost function that:

* Penalizes wrong predictions heavily.
* Rewards correct predictions.
* Works for both classes $y = 1$ and $y = 0$.

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Derivation

#### Step 1: Cost function when **$y = 1$**

We want:

* $h_\theta(x) \to 1$ ⇒ cost → 0 (perfect prediction).
* $h_\theta(x) \to 0$ ⇒ cost → ∞ (bad prediction).

So, define cost:

$$
\text{Cost}(h_\theta(x), y=1) = -\log(h_\theta(x))
$$

#### Step 2: Cost function when **$y = 0$**

We want:

* $h_\theta(x) \to 0$ ⇒ cost → 0 (perfect prediction).
* $h_\theta(x) \to 1$ ⇒ cost → ∞ (bad prediction).

So, define cost:

$$
\text{Cost}(h_\theta(x), y=0) = -\log(1 - h_\theta(x))
$$

---

### 🔁 Step 3: Combine Both Cases into One Formula

We combine both cases into **one expression** using $y \in \{0, 1\}$:

$$
\text{Cost}(h_\theta(x), y) = -y \log(h_\theta(x)) - (1 - y) \log(1 - h_\theta(x))
$$

This works because:

* If $y = 1$: the second term vanishes ⇒ cost becomes $-\log(h_\theta(x))$
* If $y = 0$: the first term vanishes ⇒ cost becomes $-\log(1 - h_\theta(x))$

This is the **binary cross-entropy loss** or **log-loss** used in logistic regression.

### Examples on Logistic Regression Cost function

---

### ✅ Formula Recap

$$
\text{Cost}(h_\theta(x), y) = -y \log(h_\theta(x)) - (1 - y) \log(1 - h_\theta(x))
$$

Where:

* $h_\theta(x)$ is the predicted probability (output of sigmoid)
* $y$ is the actual label (0 or 1)

---

### 🔢 Example 1: Suppose

* **Actual label** $y = 1$
* **Predicted probability** $h_\theta(x) = 0.9$

Apply the formula:

$$
\text{Cost} = -1 \cdot \log(0.9) - (1 - 1) \cdot \log(1 - 0.9)
$$

$$
\text{Cost} = -\log(0.9)
\approx -(-0.105) = 0.105
$$

➡️ **Interpretation**: Low cost ⇒ the prediction is **good** (close to the actual label).

---

### 🔢 Example 2: Suppose

* **Actual label** $y = 1$
* **Predicted probability** $h_\theta(x) = 0.1$

$$
\text{Cost} = -1 \cdot \log(0.1) - (1 - 1) \cdot \log(1 - 0.1)
= -\log(0.1) \approx 2.302
$$

➡️ **Interpretation**: High cost ⇒ the prediction is **bad**.

---

### 🔢 Example 3: Suppose

* **Actual label** $y = 0$
* **Predicted probability** $h_\theta(x) = 0.2$

$$
\text{Cost} = -0 \cdot \log(0.2) - (1 - 0) \cdot \log(1 - 0.2)
= -\log(0.8) \approx 0.223
$$

➡️ Again, low cost (close to correct).

---

## 🔷 **6. Final Cost Function for All Training Examples**

$$
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left[ -y^{(i)} \log(h_\theta(x^{(i)})) - (1 - y^{(i)}) \log(1 - h_\theta(x^{(i)})) \right]
$$

✅ This cost function is **convex**, even with the sigmoid, so **gradient descent** works reliably.

---

## 🔷 **7. Gradient Descent Update Rule**

To minimize the cost function:

$$
\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} J(\theta)
$$

Where:

* \$\alpha\$ = learning rate
* \$\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta\_j} J(\theta)\$ is the partial derivative of the cost w\.r.t. parameter \$\theta\_j\$

---

## 🔷 **8. Decision Boundary**

In logistic regression, the **decision boundary** is where:

$$
h_\theta(x) = 0.5
\Rightarrow \theta^T x = 0
$$

✅ **Not** the sigmoid curve itself, but the **linear separator** defined by \$\theta^T x = 0\$.

---

## 🔷 **9. Behavior of the Cost Function (Visual Intuition)**


The cost function behaves differently based on the actual label `y`:

### ✅ **When** $y = 1$:

$$
\text{Cost} = -\log(h_\theta(x))
$$

* If $h_\theta(x) \to 1$, then $\log(h_\theta(x)) \to 0 \Rightarrow \text{Cost} \to 0$
* If $h_\theta(x) \to 0$, then $\log(h_\theta(x)) \to -\infty \Rightarrow \text{Cost} \to \infty$

🧠 So, the model is penalized **heavily** when it predicts a low probability for class 1.

---

### ✅ **When** $y = 0$:

$$
\text{Cost} = -\log(1 - h_\theta(x))
$$

* If $h_\theta(x) \to 0$, then $\log(1 - h_\theta(x)) \to 0 \Rightarrow \text{Cost} \to 0$
* If $h_\theta(x) \to 1$, then $\log(1 - h_\theta(x)) \to -\infty \Rightarrow \text{Cost} \to \infty$

🧠 So, the model is penalized **heavily** when it predicts a high probability for class 1, while the actual class is 0.

---

## 🔷 **10. Summary of Key Equations**

### 🔹 Sigmoid Function:

$$
h_\theta(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\theta^T x}}
$$

### 🔹 Cost Function:

$$
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left[ -y^{(i)} \log(h_\theta(x^{(i)})) - (1 - y^{(i)}) \log(1 - h_\theta(x^{(i)})) \right]
$$

### 🔹 Gradient Descent:

$$
\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} J(\theta)
$$

## Logististic Regression Cost function analysis

### ✅ 1. **Goal of Logistic Regression**

We want to model the probability that an input `x` belongs to class `1`:

$$
h_\theta(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\theta^T x}}
$$

Here, $h_\theta(x)$ is the **sigmoid function**, and its output is interpreted as:

* $h_\theta(x) \approx 1$: model thinks class = 1
* $h_\theta(x) \approx 0$: model thinks class = 0

---

### ✅ 2. **Binary Classification Setup**

For each training example $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$:

* $y^{(i)} \in \{0, 1\}$
* $h_\theta(x^{(i)})$ is the predicted probability that $y = 1$

We want a cost function that penalizes incorrect predictions and rewards correct ones **asymmetrically**.

### ✅ 3. **Why Log Loss?**

We define two cases for the cost:

* If $y = 1$: we want $h_\theta(x)$ to be close to 1
  → cost = $-\log(h_\theta(x))$
* If $y = 0$: we want $h_\theta(x)$ to be close to 0
  → cost = $-\log(1 - h_\theta(x))$

This gives us the piecewise cost function in your image:

$$
\text{Cost}(h_\theta(x), y) = 
\begin{cases}
  -\log(h_\theta(x)) & \text{if } y = 1 \\
  -\log(1 - h_\theta(x)) & \text{if } y = 0
\end{cases}
$$

✅ What is Log Loss?
Log Loss (also called Logarithmic Loss or Binary Cross-Entropy) is a loss function used when we're predicting probabilities for binary classification.

It measures how far off the predicted probability is from the actual class label (0 or 1), with a strong penalty for being confidently wrong.

### ✅ 4. **Combine Into a Single Expression**

To simplify implementation and allow for vectorization, combine both cases into **one formula**:

$$
\text{Cost}(h_\theta(x), y) = - y \log(h_\theta(x)) - (1 - y) \log(1 - h_\theta(x))
$$

This works because:

* When $y = 1$: second term becomes 0
* When $y = 0$: first term becomes 0

---

### ✅ 5. **Total Cost for All Examples**

The overall cost function $J(\theta)$ for **m training examples** is:

$$
J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left[ y^{(i)} \log(h_\theta(x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \log(1 - h_\theta(x^{(i)})) \right]
$$

---

### ⚠️ Correction:

In the image you shared, the formula incorrectly uses:

$$
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum ...
$$

🔴 That $\frac{1}{2m}$ is **not standard in logistic regression** — it belongs to **linear regression**.
✅ It should be:

$$
J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left[ y^{(i)} \log(h_\theta(x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \log(1 - h_\theta(x^{(i)})) \right]
$$

### 🧮 Small Example:

Suppose we have 1 training example:

* $x = [1, 2], y = 1$
* $\theta = [0.5, -0.25]$

1. Compute $\theta^T x = 0.5 \cdot 1 + (-0.25) \cdot 2 = 0.5 - 0.5 = 0$
2. $h_\theta(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^0} = 0.5$
3. $\text{Cost} = -y \log(h_\theta(x)) - (1 - y) \log(1 - h_\theta(x)) = -1 \cdot \log(0.5) = 0.693$
